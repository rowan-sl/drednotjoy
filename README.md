controller support for https://drednot.io

this currently only has support for the sn30pro controller, as that is what it was made and tested with.
it probably could work with the xbox360 with some modifications to the sn30pro library.

this program maps the inputs on the controller to keyboard and mouse inputs
that are convenient for playing drednot.
